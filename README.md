watson-usermodeling-python
==========================

IBM Watson User Modeling sample Python application.

This is a sample application that uses the Watson User Modeling service from [IBM Bluemix](http://bluemix.net).
It is just meant to describe how you can use Python to connect to the Watson services; not as a real world
application. Everyone is welcome to fork the repository or reuse this example code.
